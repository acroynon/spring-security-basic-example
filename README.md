# Basic Spring Security Example

A basic example of a Spring Boot application that uses Spring Security to authenticate and authorize requests.

This is very messy and very hacky, I was exploring the basic of Spring Security and wasn't too worried about unit tests or neat code.
I do plan on coming back to this and tidying it up (e.g. independent UI, additional feature, unit tests, etc).
